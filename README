APRS Tracker for Raspberry Pi 
Copyright (C) 2012  Mauri Niininen AG1LE

A simple Javascript based  web page that uses  APRS.FI  JSON API and Nokia Maps API to find 
the latest position of an APRS enabled ham radio station. 

You need to sign-up  to APRS.FI  and get an API key from here: http://aprs.fi/page/api

Then edit the index.html file and insert your API key in the following line - replace xxxxxxxx:

var myquery = encodeURIComponent('select * from json where url="http://api.aprs.fi/api/get?name='+mycallsign+'&what=loc&apikey=xxxxxxxx&format=json"'); 


Try entering for example W1MRA-C  in the "Find"  field. 
You should get a map of Boston with station W1MRA-C located on or around Prudential Center. 

"GeoFence" will draw a circle around the found station. No other functionality has been implemented yet. 

"Track"  does the same as "GeoFence" button in the first release.

NOTE:  This is prototype code to demonstrate mashup of multiple APIs
